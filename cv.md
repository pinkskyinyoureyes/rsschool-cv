***About me***

I am 27 years old and I work in the quality control department of a woodworking industry. A year ago, I became interested in creating websites, and this interest has grown into an in-depth study. In my free time, I watched tutorial videos on YouTube and mastered layout. I like to immediately see the result of my work and explore new possibilities. In the process of studying the material, I came to the fact that I want to become a front-end developer. And so I found [RS School](https://rs.school/)!

***Skills***

* HTML
* CSS, SASS
* JavaScript (basics)
* Git, GitHub
* VS Code, Figma, Chrome DevTools

***Code example***

```JS
function EvenOrOdd(number) {
  if (number % 2 == 0) {
    return "Even"
  } else {
    return "Odd"
  }
}
```

***Experience***

I make layouts and pet-projects in my free time.
