***About me***

Two year ago, I became interested in creating websites, and this interest has grown into an in-depth study. In my free time, I watched tutorial videos on YouTube and mastered layout. I like to see the result of my work and explore new possibilities. In the process of studying the material, I came to the fact that I want to become a front-end developer. A friend showed me a course from [The Rolling Scopes School](https://rs.school/), I really liked it, and first of all because of the powerful community. Since then I have been studying front-end on a [course JavaScript/Front-End](https://rs.school/js).

***Skills***

* HTML
* CSS, SASS
* JavaScript (basics)
* Git, GitHub
* VS Code, Figma, Chrome DevTools

***Code example***

```JS
